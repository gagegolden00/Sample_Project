### RESOURCE METHOD IN ROUTES.RB ###

    1) The "resources" method used in the routes.rb file defines the RESTful routes
    for a specific resource.

    2) It generates a set of standard routes for CRUD operations only related to the
    resource it is applied to.

    3) Here is a list of standards routes generated by the resources method
    (got these from gpt)

        GET /articles: Maps to the index action of the ArticlesController.
         It retrieves a collection of all articles.

        POST /articles: Maps to the create action of the ArticlesController.
        It creates a new article based on the provided parameters.

        GET /articles/:id: Maps to the show action of the ArticlesController.
        It retrieves a specific article by its :id parameter.

        GET /articles/new: Maps to the new action of the ArticlesController.
        It renders a form to create a new article.

        GET /articles/:id/edit: Maps to the edit action of the ArticlesController.
        It renders a form to edit a specific article.

        PATCH/PUT /articles/:id: Maps to the update action of the ArticlesController.
        It updates a specific article based on the provided parameters.

        DELETE /articles/:id: Maps to the destroy action of the ArticlesController.
        It deletes a specific article.

        You can always customize, add, remove as needed this just generates a lot
        for you. It seems in rails that occurs a lot. Generation of what expected to
        be used and then you go and change, create, or delete as necessary. pretty cool.

    4) FURTHERMORE you can be more explicit with it like so

        resources :articles, only [:show]

        Will only generate the show routes aka GETs
