variable_name.error.full_messages = a great description of the error for instance
if you try to init a new article obj as a var with new and your validation stops
you because a title is not present then this command will reveal that.

EXAMPLE = it will let you create it in memory but NOT save it to the database
interesting...ðŸ¤” I personally dont think is should even be allowed to exist in memory

irb(main):004:0> new_article_new = Article.new(title: "new article new title")
=>
#<Article:0x000000010d275ae8
...
irb(main):005:0> new_article
=>
#<Article:0x000000010d313400
 id: nil,
 title: "new article title",
 created_at: nil,
 updated_at: nil,
 description: nil>
irb(main):006:0> new_article_new.save
=> false
irb(main):007:0> new_article_new.errors.full_messages
=> ["Description can't be blank"]
